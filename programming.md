# Programming

The hardware for the controller will be an MSP430. There are several programming options to choose from. The most notably C. I believe C programming is considerably easier than programming assembly. Even so I believe assembly is the only option for this project. My primary motivation is the timing option. Assembly allows me to calculate exactly how many cycles are used per instruction. Practically garuanteeing an ability to create solid servo timing pulses. This does not seem to be true for C.

Assembly does make things a lot harder. The low level nature means I need a far greater understanding of the controller. Also easy things like control structures in C (if else and loops) are more difficult. I guess this is where that understanding comes in.

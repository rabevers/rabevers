Hi, I am Richard. I'm a web developer in the Netherlands. I have a wide variety
of interests:

* Web development (duh)
* Mobile robotics (Someday I hope to build a hexapod)
* Photography (Today's photography is somewhat limited to my two kids)
* Tv/Movies (I tend to watch a lot)
* Eve Online (Internet spaceships)

Some of these you might read about here.

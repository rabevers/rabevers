For as long as I can remember I have wanted to build a hexapod walking robot.
In the past 15 years I have started up the project several times only having
to quit a while later because of limited time and money.

I started out using a Jackrabbit somewhere in 1998. Followed by a PIC
microcontroller in 2005. Then I found out about MSP430Å› from Texas Instruments.
They had a launchpad to easily start developing with them.

With the development software they offered, in combination with the launchpad,
development started out easy.

This page will keep track of my progress, if there is any. I will try to post
updates of my work, but as stated before, I'm a terrible blogger.

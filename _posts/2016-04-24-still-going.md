title: Still going
---

In my first post I mentioned that I am a terrible blogger. Last year I started
a new job which turned out to be quite challenging. That in combination with
being a father and a few other projects that take precedence means I have very
little time to actually spent on the controller.

The servo controller project however is still going, even though it is at a
stand still at the moment.

Perhaps I should mention the other things I to.

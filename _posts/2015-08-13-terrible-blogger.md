title: Terrible blogger
---

Several times before I started a blog and in each of those instances I stopped
after only a few posts. Whenever my interests changed or I got too busy in my
personal live. 

This time I hope to break that cycle. Partly by doing things differently. Not
using an elaborate blogging tool like Wordpress. Instead something much simpler
and for some much harder. By using Jekyll and Github.

I have used Github before but Jekyll is a first. So lets see how long I keep it
up this time. Also I'm not limiting myself as to what I post on here so who
knows what you might find.

title: Servo controller update

In my previous post I ended with me reading up on interrupts and timers. After
doing said reading I came to the same conclusion I did a while ago. I'm severly
lacking knowledge of actually program the msp430 in assembly.

So before I can actually make a better proposal for the sequence and timing I
figure I need some more experience. It seems like a good idea to just start
programming in assembly and see how everything works.

TI (of course) has several documents to help me get started

* [MSP430 Assembly Language Tools User's guide](http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slau131j/slau131j.pdf)
* [MSP430x2xx Family User's guide](http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slau144j/slau144j.pdf)
* [Datasheet MSP430G2x53](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/msp430g2553.pdf) (I plan on using an msp430g2553)

Other than that I have to search the Internet. I found there are many examples
and explanations but most of them are written in C. There are some assembler
tutorials but so far I have not found any that go a little deeper than just
an introduction.

This will take longer than I thought.
